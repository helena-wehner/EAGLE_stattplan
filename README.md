# Stattplan

This Shiny App enables you to select a bavarian city and see where you can buy biological, regional and seasonal food, clothes, 
find reataurants, see where repair cafes and co-working areas are.

This Application was developed within a university course of the EAGLE study program at the Univesity of Wuerzburg (http://eagle-science.org/)
and will be constantly improved as project of the students environmental group of the University of Wuerzburg, called "Referat Ökologie" 
(https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/stuv/referat-ak/oekologie/). 

Because the students environmental group is also part of a bavarian network of students environmental groups (SINNsüdost), more and more bavarian cities will
be added to this application.

If you have any suggestions, wishes or hints, please let me know (write a message via "Iusses" Tab).
